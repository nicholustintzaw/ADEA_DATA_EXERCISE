# ADEA DATA EXERCISE

## File Organization:
- 01_raw: Contains all the raw data used for this exercise.
- 02_do: Includes all the STATA do-files applied in this workflow.
- 03_dta: Consists of all the intermediate datasets and codebooks generated in this work.
- 04_out: Stores all the final datasets resulting from this exercise.

## Statistical Software:
I primarily used STATA for this task due to urgent deadlines in my current work. If required, I can also perform the task in Python, although it may take additional time (approximately 6 hours compared to the 3 hours in STATA). You can verify the GitHub push history for the steps I took, including data checking and validation notes included in the do-files after each command.


## Final output 
### Test one
 - dataset: sde1_2017_18_to_2021_22_FINAL.csv
 - codebook : sde1_2017_18_to_2021_22 codebook FINAL.xlsx


### Test two 
 - dataset : Test_2_enrollment_per_region_per_academicyear.csv
 - codebook: Test 2 enrollment by region per academic year codebook FINAL.xlsx
